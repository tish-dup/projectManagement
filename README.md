To keep track of projects created in the program

This is a simple java program to keep track of projects created by an engineering firm. 

This program allows user to capture information about new projects. If the project name is not provided, then the program will use the surname of the client and the type of building as a project name. The user can also update information about existing projects, for example the deadline of the projects and change the fee paid to date. In addition, the user can update the contact details of either the contractor, architect or client. 

When a project needs to be finalised, the program does the following:
1. Generate an invoice for the client. The invoice contains the client's details, details of the project and the total amount outstanding. If the client has already paid in full, the invoice will not be generated. 
2. The project is then marked as "finalised" and the completion date is added. 

This program is very useful for any firm that needs to keep track of their projects and wishes to have their invoices processed automatically.
